Hello, my name is Mohammed Reda, and I am currently studying at Grenoble INP - Ensimag, a prestigious French institution specializing in computer science and applied mathematics. I am passionate about data science and engineering, with a strong focus on machine learning (ML) models and data visualization.

My goal is to become a skilled data scientist or data engineer, applying my expertise to solve complex problems and drive data-driven decision-making. At Grenoble INP - Ensimag, I am actively developing my skills through hands-on projects and coursework, keeping abreast of the latest advancements in the field.
